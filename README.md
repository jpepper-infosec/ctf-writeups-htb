# ðŸ§  Hack The Box CTF Write-ups

This repository contains write-ups for **retired Hack The Box (HTB) machines**. Each walkthrough demonstrates the methodology, tools, and reasoning behind each stage of the attack â€” with a strong emphasis on clarity, responsible disclosure, and personal learning outcomes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Practise real-world enumeration and exploitation
- Build repeatable methodology and habits

Each write-up will be added as a separate Markdown file under `/retired-machines`, including:

- Attack Surface Analysis  
- Exploitation Path  
- Privilege Escalation  
- Takeaways and Observations

## ðŸ“Œ Important

All machines are legally accessed via the **Hack The Box platform** and are publicly marked as **retired**. These write-ups are intended for **educational use only** and reflect learning conducted in structured and authorised environments.
